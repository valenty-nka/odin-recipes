            <li>
              <h5>For the Hollandaise sauce:</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Melt the butter in a small saucepan. In a separate small bowl,
                  beat the egg yolks. Mix in lemon juice, whipping cream, and
                  salt and pepper.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add a small spoonful of the hot melted butter to the egg
                  mixture and stir well. Repeat this process, adding a spoonful
                  at a time of hot butter to the egg mixture. (Adding the butter
                  slowly, a spoonful at a time, will temper the eggs and ensure
                  they don't curdle).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once the butter has been incorporated, pour the mixture back
                  into the saucepan. Cook on low heat, stirring constantly, for
                  just 20-30 seconds. Remove from heat and set aside. It will
                  thicken as it cools. Stir well and add another splash of
                  cream, if needed, to thin.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h5>For the poached eggs:</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Fill a medium-size pot with about 3 inches of water. Bring the
                  water to a boil and then reduce heat until it reaches a
                  simmer. You should see small bubbles coming to the surface but
                  not rolling.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add a little splash of vinegar to the water (this is optional,
                  but it helps the egg white to stay together once it is in the
                  water).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Crack one egg into a small cup (I use a measuring cup). Lower
                  the egg into the simmer water, gently easing it out of the
                  cup.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cook the egg in simmering water for 3-5 minutes, depending on
                  how soft you want your egg yolk. Remove the poached egg with a
                  slotted spoon.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is not abnormal for a white foam to form on top of the
                  water when poaching an egg. You can simply skim the foam off
                  of the water with a spoon.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While the egg is cooking, place the slices of Canadian bacon
                  in a large pan and cook on medium-high heat for about 1 minute
                  on each side.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>

              <h5>To Assemble:</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Toast the English muffin. Top each toasted side with a slice
                  or two of Canadian bacon, and then a poached egg. Top with
                  hollandaise sauce.
                </li>
