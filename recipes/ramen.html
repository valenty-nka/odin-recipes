          <h3>To Prepare The Ramen Egg:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Whisk together the 1/4 cup of soy sauce, 1/4 cup of rice vinegar,
              and 3/4 cup water, set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare an ice bath by filling a bowl with ice and water.</li>
            <li>
              Bring a pot of water to boil (make sure there is enough water to
              cover the eggs). When boiling, carefully lower the eggs into the
              water using a slotted spoon or spider. Reduce heat if necessary to
              keep the water just barely boiling. Cook for 7 minutes, then
              remove from pot and place eggs in the ice bath. Leave in the ice
              bath for 3 minutes. Remove from ice bath and gently peel (egg will
              be soft). Place peeled eggs in the marinade and make sure they are
              completely covered with the marinade. Leave in the marinade for
              several hours or overnight. If keeping longer, discard the
              marinade and store in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Reheat the
              egg in the ramen broth (don't leave in the broth very long before
              serving or the egg will overcook).
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>To Prepare The Noodles:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              If using fresh noodles:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Bring a pot of water to a boil. When boiling, add the noodles
                  and simmer for 3 minutes. Strain and rinse with cold water.
                  Toss with just a little oil if necessary to keep them from
                  sticking (mine already had a little oil on them, so I didn't
                  need to). Set aside.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              (If using another type of noodle, follow package instructions)
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>To Prepare The Soup:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Heat a large pot or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the
              onion and sauté until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the
              sliced mushrooms and sauté for another 2-3 minutes. Add the garlic
              and ginger and stir fry for about 30 seconds, just until fragrant
              so that they don't burn. Add the chicken broth and 1 cup of water,
              soy sauce, rice vinegar, oyster sauce, fish sauce, chili garlic
              sauce, stir to combine. Bring back to a simmer.
            </li>
            <li>
              When broth reaches a simmer, add the chicken thighs. Simmer for
              15-20 minutes until chicken is cooked through and reaches a
              temperature of 165°F.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove the chicken and shred it with two forks. Add it back to the
              broth along with the bok choy and cook for 3-5 minutes. Remove
              from heat and serve.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>To Serve The Ramen:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In a bowl, place a serving of noodles, then pour the soup over
              them. Top soup with ramen egg, sliced green onions, cilantro and
              sesame seeds if desired.
            </li>
